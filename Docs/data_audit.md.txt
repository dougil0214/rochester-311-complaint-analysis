# 311 Data Audit – Initial Review

## Dataset Overview
- Source: City of Rochester Open Data – 311 Complaints
- Format: CSV
- Time range: 2020-2021
- Number of rows: 55,597 rows
- Number of columns: 8

## Columns Present
List the key columns observed:
- Subject 
- Reason
- Type
- Department
- Bureau
- Request Dare
- Street Name
- Zip

## Data Quality Observations

### Missing Values
- Department: Many NULL values
- Bureau: Many NULL values
- ZIP Code: Frequently blank
- ZIP code values are stored as empty strings rather than NULL; missing ZIPs identified using zip_code = '' in SQL query.
- Street Name: Mostly populated

### Consistency Issues
- Some street name appear with word "AND" then name another street 
- Records lack location detail beyond street name
- Some zipcodes come up on street names but not all 

## What This Means
- Department and Bureau cannot be reliably used for primary analysis
- Street-level analysis is the most viable starting point
- ZIP code analysis is limited due to missing data

## Decisions Made
- Focus analysis on street-level complaint patterns
- Treat missing Department/Bureau as "Unknown"
- Exclude ZIP-based analysis for initial phase

## Next Steps
- Load data into SQL database
- Run aggregation queries by street
- Identify top complaint locations
